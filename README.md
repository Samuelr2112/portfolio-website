# Portfolio Website

This repository will contain the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with **FastAPI**, **HTML/CSS/JS**, **Bootstrap** and hosted by **AWS Lightsail**.  
The site showcases my projects, technical skills, and professional experience in software engineering.

⚠️ **Note:**  
The code has not been uploaded yet, as I am still working on some important security adjustments (mainly related to environment variables and email handling).  
Once these improvements are complete, the full project will be pushed here.
